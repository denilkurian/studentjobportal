2
00:00:18,625 --> 00:00:20,625
So, you talked
to the head of homicide?

3
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:26,958
Yes. They found another chestnut man
with Kristine's fingerprints.

4
00:00:29,958 --> 00:00:31,125
It makes no sense.

5
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,333
- Why leave a chestnut man...
- I don't... I don't know.

6
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:36,500
They think it's some kind of harassment.

7
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:41,041
How about Steen, how's he coping?

8
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,916
We'll get through it. We're good together.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,833
Otherwise, let me know
if you ever need to talk.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'm here.

11
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:55,125
That's nice of you, Frederik. Thanks.

12
00:01:02,708 --> 00:01:09,458
SEARCH FOR KRISTINE HARTUNG ABANDONED

13
00:01:11,916 --> 00:01:13,375
WHERE WAS SHE TAKEN?

14
00:01:13,458 --> 00:01:16,208
COMING HOME FROM TENNIS
WHEN MURDERER STRUCK

15
00:01:34,875 --> 00:01:35,958
Hi, sweetie.

16
00:01:36,708 --> 00:01:37,708
Hi.

17
00:01:40,666 --> 00:01:41,875
Did you have a nice day?

18
00:01:43,208 --> 00:01:45,041
- Yeah, It was fine.
- Hmm?

19
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:48,541
Where's Dad? Haven't you had dinner?

20
00:01:49,541 --> 00:01:52,625
No. He's been in the office all afternoon.

21
00:01:54,625 --> 00:01:57,291
Oh. It's probably
the new building project.

22
00:01:57,375 --> 00:02:00,208
I guess. He told me not to come in.

23
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:14,541
Steen? What is all this?

24
00:02:14,625 --> 00:02:17,291
I just need
to go through it again.

25
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:24,208
What if Gustav saw all this?

26
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:27,166
What would it do to him?

27
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:32,166
I know you're still drinking.

28
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:34,375
I have stopped drinking.

29
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:38,708
You need to stop this as well.

30
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,291
We have to move forward.
For Gustav's sake.

31
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:45,666
And for ours.

32
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:49,041
I can't lie about how I feel.

33
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:54,166
Yes, you can.
I do it every single day out there.

34
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,666
- So can you.
- But I won't.

35
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:59,458
Everything's so strange.
The fingerprints are strange.

36
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:01,541
- It's strange...
- You didn't pick her up.

37
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:04,875
- That's why you're doing this.
- You didn't either.

38
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:09,125
- Not even once did you pick her up.
- But you promised!

39
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:25,791
I'm sorry.

40
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:28,541
I'm sorry, honey.

41
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,791
Just promise me you'll take all this down.

42
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:30,166
THE CHESTNUT MAN

43
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:35,625
And what about the lanterns?
Are they lit?

44
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:38,375
<i>Sure. It looks like
a Chinese light festival here.</i>

45
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:39,458
Really?

46
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,309
<i>- You should have seen it.</i>
- Oh, that's too bad.

47
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:43,208
<i>- You missed it. Too bad.
- </i>Yeah.

48
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:45,250
Can I talk to her?

49
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:48,416
<i>You know what? She doesn't have time
to talk to you right now.</i>

50
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:51,958
Okay, then say hi from me, and, uh...

51
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:54,791
<i>By the way, she asked
if she could have her ears pierced.</i>

52
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:57,666
- No, of courseshe can't!
- <i>I have to go now.</i>

53
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:06,958
- We've already started searching for him.
- Okay. Could he be our guy after all?

54
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:10,833
No, he had an alibi for
Anne Sejer-Lassen's murder, but...

55
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,458
Come with me.

56
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:21,666
We came here because of an anonymous
report about the boy's neglect.

57
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,250
- Okay.
- We found a hidden basement

58
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:25,250
that Hauge built himself,
and his computer,

59
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:26,750
which we're unlocking now.

60
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:29,500
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

61
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:33,625
The room is soundproofed,
and so is the hatch.

62
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:34,708
Mm.

63
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:38,750
It was all built under the grate.
I've never seen anything like it.

64
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:41,458
I've sent swabs of fiber to the lab.

65
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:44,500
We're checking for prints
to figure out who's been down there.

66
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:48,250
Thulin?
I've accessed Hauge's computer.

67
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:57,500
These folders are named
according to different months.

68
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,750
I don't wanna watch this.

69
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:14,083
<i>Magnus?</i>

70
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:17,041
<i>Magnus, are you ready?</i>

71
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:19,833
<i>This is going to be fun, real fun.</i>

72
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:25,500
<i>You don't want to make Mom sad, do you?</i>

73
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:30,250
<i>Okay.
Let's take off your T-shirt.</i>

74
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:34,916
<i>Yeah. That's good.</i>

75
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,541
<i>Good boy.</i>

76
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:39,500
<i>Really good.</i>

77
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,958
<i>Oh! You're so beautiful.</i>

78
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:44,333
<i>I love you so much.</i>

79
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:15,208
You'd want to kill the stepfather.

80
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:17,041
Not his mom.

81
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:22,750
His mother knew something was wrong.
That's why she changed the locks.

82
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:30,166
If the anonymous reporter
killed Laura Kjær,

83
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,583
because to him, she was a bad mother...

84
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:37,500
then... then why kill Anne Sejer-Lassen?

85
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:40,833
Maybe the killer thought
she was a bad mom too.

86
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:45,416
But why? She was packing
and about to leave her husband.

87
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:55,833
<i>Yes?</i>

88
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:59,208
Does the blood from the floor
at Sejer-Lassen's house

89
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:02,083
- belong to the daughter?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

90
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:06,291
Yeah, and we also found some, uh, from
the sister in the bathroom and in the...

91
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:08,125
uh, in the garden room.

92
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:10,791
But it's all in the report. Why?

93
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:13,791
<i>I think the girls
have had too many accidents.</i>

94
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:16,583
- What, do you think...
<i>- Thanks, I've gotta go.</i>

95
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:21,541
We need to get
the daughters' medical records.

96
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:30,208
Gentofte hospital, broken clavicle.

97
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:33,041
Broken nose.

98
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:36,791
Don't look at me. Look at the photos.

99
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:40,250
And here, from
the national hospital's trauma center,

100
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:42,166
when you lived in Copenhagen.

101
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:47,708
- Fall from the stairs, huh?
- Yeah. I already told you, it wasn't me.

102
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:50,072
- It was an accident.
- We know what you did to your kids.

103
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:53,416
The question is, who else knows?

104
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:58,041
The state attorney has decided

105
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:00,916
to prosecute you
for violence against your children.

106
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,250
You may never see your girls again.
Do you understand?

107
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:11,125
I love my kids, okay?

108
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:12,791
I do.

109
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:13,875
Who knew?

110
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:16,416
Your wife knew.

111
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:20,666
Or she was beginning to suspect it.

112
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:35,458
I tried to get help, okay?
I even talked to someone after the report.

113
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,208
Wh... what report?

114
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:38,541
Uh, to the district.

115
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:41,041
A case worker came out,
but I put my lawyer on it,

116
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:44,375
- so nothing came of it.
- A case worker from Gentofte?

117
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:45,958
From Copenhagen.

118
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:53,166
I specifically asked if there was
a report. The case worker said no.

119
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:55,375
Who filed that report?

120
00:09:57,958 --> 00:09:59,875
I don't know. It was anonymous.

121
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:05,083
Yes.

122
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:06,583
Yeah, okay.

123
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:09,500
That's just really annoying. Thanks a lot.

124
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,416
What's up?

125
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:16,083
Child and youth services
can't help until tomorrow.

126
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:18,958
- And only if we get a court order.
- I'll get that.

127
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:21,833
- And you're sure I can take the car?
- Sure. Take it.

128
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:27,333
Thank you for getting me out of that hole.

129
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:38,750
Hi.

130
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:40,791
- Hey!
- Took a chance and came over.

131
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:42,208
- Yeah.
- Are you off?

132
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:44,750
- Yeah, I am.
- Hi.

133
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:46,708
- Hi.
- Sebastian.

134
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:48,916
This is Hess. He's my, um...

135
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:50,625
partner.

136
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:00,500
Can... can I get the key?

137
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:02,583
Yeah.

138
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,125
See you tomorrow.

139
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:13,598
- But where is she now?
- Sleeping at Aksel's.

140
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:16,875
Too bad.
I was looking forward to seeing her again.

141
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:19,833
- Yeah.
- But there are advantages.

142
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:23,083
- We get more time together.
- Mm!

143
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:25,666
- You left last time, remember?
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

144
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:30,708
You know what? I'm... I'm really tired.
I'm not really up for, uh...

145
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:32,875
No, no, no, no.
We don't have to do anything.

146
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:36,875
We'll just sit here,
have some wine and hang out, right?

147
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,125
I do have a wild fantasy
about us going away for the weekend.

148
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:49,916
No, no, no.
I'm not going on any weekend trip.

149
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:52,833
Like, do you even realize what I do?

150
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:55,083
No, because you can't tell me.

151
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:57,791
Wh... what is it you want from me?
Huh?

152
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:00,041
What do you mean?

153
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:05,208
Are you dreaming of your own toothbrush
here, or me meeting your mom soon, or...

154
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:08,125
You think that's what I want?

155
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:12,250
Well, I think it's natural for you
to dream of moving in

156
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:15,250
and having your own kids at some point.

157
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:17,458
Yeah, yeah. Sure. Of course.

158
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,750
I don't think
I can give you what you want.

159
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:27,708
You can't, or you won't?

160
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:38,458
What the hell's happening?

161
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:42,250
Is it that bum in the car, or what?

162
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:46,708
Then what?

163
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:49,625
Can you please leave?

164
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:59,291
Now, what the fuck is this? All I do
is letting your oh-so-important job

165
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:02,208
dictate when we see each other,
and where, and how.

166
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,291
You know what? You are so fucking cold.

167
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:18,875
You only care about yourself.

168
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:10,291
I was held up when you called.

169
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:12,833
- <i>I thought you wanted to come back.</i>
- And I do.

170
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:15,000
<i>- So why...</i>
- It's a bit complicated right now.

171
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:19,000
<i>The longer you wait, the more complicated
things get down here as well, no?</i>

172
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:21,708
- I'm calling Freymann tomorrow.
<i>- Oof. You'd better.</i>

173
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:38,166
Hey! There you are!

174
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:40,208
You work too much.

175
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:44,541
Uh, this is Rizwan, the guy
I told you about. The estate agent.

176
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:45,625
- Hey.
- Hi.

177
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:47,541
- I just wanted to show him the flat...
- Huh.

178
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:49,333
...so he could give you a good price.

179
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:52,541
- Yes.
- Think about it.

180
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,708
He sells ten percent above average.

181
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:56,291
See you.

182
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:59,416
Oh, by the way,
I put the floor sander in there.

183
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Thanks.

184
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:05,125
WEDNESDAY, 14 OCTOBER

185
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:07,291
<i>The investigation
into the killings</i>

186
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:10,958
<i>of 37-year-old Laura Kjær,
a clinic nurse from Husum,</i>

187
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:13,916
<i>and 36-year-old
Anne Sejer-Lassen from Klampenborg</i>

188
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,375
<i>has raised speculation about whether
there's a connection between the two.</i>

189
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,976
- I need this signature.
<i>- The killings happened a few days apart,</i>

190
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,333
<i>and anonymous sources say</i>

191
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:23,176
<i>- there are certain similarities.</i>
- And here.

192
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,500
- <i>The police will not reveal...</i>
- Are you ready?

193
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:26,708
- <i>...same offender.</i>
- Yes.

194
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:29,541
Where are we going?

195
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:32,875
Bukke's closing the final amendments
in the conference room.

196
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:34,208
He's finally caved.

197
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:37,583
Great. Go ahead, Engells and Frederik.
I need to talk to Liv.

198
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:42,166
Liv, has the head of homicide tried
to contact me again?

199
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:46,166
No. But I've heard that the detectives
contacted child and youth services.

200
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:47,875
Why would they?

201
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:49,416
I don't know.

202
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:53,083
I called to get some stats
from Copenhagen this morning, and...

203
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:57,125
I gathered the whole department was
at a standstill due to a search.

204
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:58,250
A search?

205
00:15:58,333 --> 00:15:59,583
Yeah.

206
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:01,833
- Hey. Hey, Liv.
- Hi.

207
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:08,333
- Mmm... do you have a minute?
- Yes. I'll be right there.

208
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:13,958
- Um... I'm, uh... a bit busy.
- Yes, of course.

209
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:17,208
You... you forgot your keys.

210
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:21,458
Thank you.

211
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:31,250
- Steen, what...
- I've thought about it.

212
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,833
What you said yesterday. About Gustav.

213
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,750
I think you are right.

214
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,958
Of course we have to protect him.

215
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:49,125
So I... I won't go on...

216
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,791
We've decided to go see a movie later.

217
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:58,250
- Oh. Lovely.
- Yeah.

218
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:01,083
I wish I could go.

219
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:03,291
You know, um...

220
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:06,000
Maybe I can move some meetings.

221
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:09,166
I'll have a look.

222
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:12,083
Maybe we should grab a burger before?

223
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:13,583
- Rosa?
- Yeah.

224
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:19,291
I mean... only if you have the time.

225
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:20,375
Yes.

226
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:22,166
Okay. Let's talk later.

227
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,958
- See you later.
- Yes, honey.

228
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:29,291
I'll leave you to it.

229
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:30,958
Mmm.

230
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:46,583
The problem is that when we talked
yesterday, the system crashed...

231
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:48,059
- No. No, it didn't.
- I couldn't...

232
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:50,500
You told me there was no report
on Sejer-Lassen.

233
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:52,166
No, you must have misheard me...

234
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:55,625
I think you saw a notice
from the national hospital

235
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:57,333
when you looked them up in your system.

236
00:17:57,416 --> 00:17:59,125
A notice that you didn't check up on.

237
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:01,458
Then you panicked,
and now the mother's dead.

238
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:02,833
You made a mistake.

239
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:05,291
I'm so sorry if we've delayed your work.

240
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:10,583
I assure you that our social workers
are working hard to manage the workload.

241
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:14,541
- Yeah. And we did talk to the family...
- Look, don't apologize to me,

242
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:17,166
apologize to the girls
who had the shit kicked out of them.

243
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,500
- And to the boy who was abused.
- You got a minute?

244
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,916
Yes, I do. I'm getting nowhere here.

245
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:25,625
I've compared the two reports.

246
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:29,708
One against Laura Kjær
and the other against Sejer-Lassen.

247
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:35,125
SELFISH WHORE

248
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:41,791
"That selfish whore.
She should know better."

249
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:43,916
- The same. The wording's the same.
- Exactly.

250
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,041
If the perpetrator made reports
about people who were then killed,

251
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:51,833
he might have reported
his next victim already.

252
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:56,375
Hey, you two.

253
00:18:56,458 --> 00:19:00,500
We need all anonymous reports
about neglect and abuse in the last year.

254
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:03,166
Just the cases
where you found no need to intervene.

255
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,833
Come on! Get to it.

256
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:05,916
- Yeah.
- Of course.

257
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:21,291
What...

258
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:24,833
- What's all this?
- The cases from social services.

259
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:27,958
I think we have to bring in more people
to get through this quickly.

260
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,541
Of course. Thomsen, you handle that.

261
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:31,791
Let me know if you find anything.

262
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:34,625
And we need to talk to Rosa Hartung again.

263
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:38,458
Is there something I should know?

264
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:43,083
No, there isn't, but the perpetrator
is most likely the anonymous reporter.

265
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:47,208
He's killed two women
whom he deemed irresponsible mothers

266
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:50,208
and he left Kristine Hartung's
prints at the scenes.

267
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:52,916
It has to be a message
to the minister of social affairs.

268
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,416
I get that, but I don't think

269
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,375
- she has any new information.
- No, but we have to be sure.

270
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:01,333
Let me tell you something.

271
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:05,416
I lived in those two's living room
for three months.

272
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,750
Every single day, I saw two parents
go from hope to deep despair and back.

273
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:12,166
- I can't put them through that again.
- No.

274
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:16,791
And it wouldn't feel good either
if it turned out you were wrong, would it?

275
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:20,041
I'm not wrong, Hess.

276
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:33,625
HE PISSES HIS PANTS IN FEAR
WHEN SHE SAYS THINGS LIKE...

277
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:46,166
...I'VE SEEN THE BITCH
GRAB AND SHAKE HER BOY IN THE PLAYGROUND.

278
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:57,208
...DON'T CARE ABOUT THEIR KIDS.

279
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:10,000
How far have you got?

280
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:13,791
I can't find any mention
of "selfish whore"

281
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:16,875
or "she should know better",
as we saw in the other two reports.

282
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:20,000
- Why did you take these out? Can I look?
- Yes.

283
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,333
Both Laura Kjær and Anne Sejer-Lassen
were acquited by the district,

284
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:24,916
although the children were suffering,

285
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,791
so I looked for others
they might have been wrong about.

286
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,083
These are the same five I took out.

287
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:36,500
These families seem highly dysfunctional.

288
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:40,916
It's such a long shot.

289
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:44,000
It makes no sense.

290
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:46,708
Why not just kill them?

291
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:49,041
Why report them first?

292
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:53,625
Maybe he gave the authorities
one last chance to intervene,

293
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:54,750
but they didn't.

294
00:21:58,625 --> 00:22:01,208
What if he changed
the way he writes?

295
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:02,458
Mmm?

296
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:07,833
Okay, so if you were the killer
and you wrote the first two reports,

297
00:22:07,916 --> 00:22:10,083
and knew we were looking for the third...

298
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:11,875
How would you write that?

299
00:22:11,958 --> 00:22:15,750
The readability stats aren't very high
in the reports on the victims.

300
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:19,666
So if the perpetrator
is wanting to confuse us...

301
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:20,583
Yes?

302
00:22:20,666 --> 00:22:24,000
...then there are at least
two that stand out.

303
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:29,541
They're both well-articulated,
without misspelled words or typos.

304
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,458
And which is better written?

305
00:22:35,166 --> 00:22:36,375
Jessie Kvium's.

306
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:42,291
"Jessie Kvium, 24 years old, lives alone
with her daughter Olivia, aged six."

307
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:43,791
"No contact with the father."

308
00:22:43,875 --> 00:22:47,583
The accuser reports that Jessie's often
very drunk while with her daughter.

309
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:49,583
And the neighbors often complain
about visitors

310
00:22:49,666 --> 00:22:52,541
and loud music from the apartment
all through the night.

311
00:23:00,166 --> 00:23:03,041
In, out, in, out, in, out.

312
00:23:04,375 --> 00:23:05,375
Good.

313
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,833
In, out, in, out. Out!

314
00:23:09,875 --> 00:23:11,000
And come in.

315
00:23:12,166 --> 00:23:14,291
Side to side. Arms up.

316
00:23:15,166 --> 00:23:18,458
And on vacation, we took a walk
and then we went into this hotal.

317
00:23:18,541 --> 00:23:19,958
We just went in to take a look.

318
00:23:20,041 --> 00:23:21,726
- This huge infinity pool, right?
- Arms up!

319
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:24,791
So there was no question about it.
We have to go back, pack our stuff

320
00:23:24,875 --> 00:23:27,000
- and check in here instead...
- Hi, Nikolaj.

321
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,916
Hi. Yeah.

322
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,083
Even though it wasn't the plan,

323
00:23:31,166 --> 00:23:33,583
what else can you do there
apart from lie in the pool?

324
00:23:33,666 --> 00:23:36,458
So, yeah. My point is,
I can really recommend it.

325
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:39,666
Were you at
the parent-teacher meeting last Friday?

326
00:23:40,458 --> 00:23:42,000
No, my wife went.

327
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:45,958
There's something important
I'd like to talk to you about

328
00:23:46,041 --> 00:23:48,750
with regards to the class culture.

329
00:23:52,125 --> 00:23:53,958
Would you excuse me for a minute?

330
00:24:38,791 --> 00:24:40,958
That was the last time. You got that?

331
00:24:41,041 --> 00:24:42,291
I'm married.

332
00:24:43,541 --> 00:24:45,791
So stop following me, for God's sake.

333
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:57,291
Fuck you, you smug jerk.

334
00:24:57,875 --> 00:25:00,291
Take your fucking Audi
and stick it up your ass.

335
00:25:04,333 --> 00:25:05,708
Fucking... door!

336
00:25:05,791 --> 00:25:06,791
Hello!

337
00:25:28,541 --> 00:25:29,541
Hello?

338
00:25:46,625 --> 00:25:47,625
Hello?

339
00:26:01,416 --> 00:26:02,333
Hello?

340
00:26:30,541 --> 00:26:33,458
How can we be sure
that she's the next victim?

341
00:26:34,666 --> 00:26:36,750
What you're suggesting sounds risky.

342
00:26:37,333 --> 00:26:39,583
We can't be sure,
but she's our first choice.

343
00:26:39,666 --> 00:26:43,833
If we look at the number of days between
the two first murders, we can't wait.

344
00:26:44,458 --> 00:26:47,458
So... what exactly are you saying?

345
00:26:47,541 --> 00:26:49,916
That there's a creepy stalker out there?

346
00:26:51,041 --> 00:26:53,625
We need to find out
who sent the anonymous report.

347
00:26:53,708 --> 00:26:56,041
I told you,
it was one of the moms from school.

348
00:26:56,125 --> 00:26:57,375
But we don't think so.

349
00:26:57,458 --> 00:26:59,698
Know how annoying it is
to have the district on your ass?

350
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:02,500
Okay, look.
If there's anything to this report,

351
00:27:02,583 --> 00:27:03,892
you could be in danger.

352
00:27:03,916 --> 00:27:05,458
- Do you get that?
- But there isn't.

353
00:27:11,708 --> 00:27:15,541
You said you felt like
someone was after you.

354
00:27:16,375 --> 00:27:17,750
- In the mall.
- Under the mall.

355
00:27:18,583 --> 00:27:19,625
In the basement.

356
00:27:20,958 --> 00:27:22,083
Tell me what happened.

357
00:27:22,583 --> 00:27:25,000
- Already told this to the other one.
- Tell me.

358
00:27:26,666 --> 00:27:29,958
I heard footsteps,
and they stopped every time I did.

359
00:27:30,041 --> 00:27:33,333
- Did you see anything?
- No. I said that as well.

360
00:27:33,416 --> 00:27:36,541
- It was dark.
- And what were you doing in the basement?

361
00:27:43,583 --> 00:27:44,583
Okay.

362
00:27:52,208 --> 00:27:54,208
What do you think? Could she be the one?

363
00:27:55,291 --> 00:27:56,750
It could be her.

364
00:27:56,833 --> 00:27:59,166
According to district,
Jessie Kvium's an alcoholic.

365
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:02,666
There's been meetings at school. Teachers
think she's neglecting her daughter.

366
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:06,083
And she thought
someone was following her at the mall.

367
00:28:06,166 --> 00:28:07,791
Captain, look at this.

368
00:28:08,291 --> 00:28:09,666
I think we have a problem.

369
00:28:10,583 --> 00:28:12,416
BREAKING: IS KRISTINE HARTUNG ALIVE?

370
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,458
- Yeah.
- God damn it.

371
00:28:15,083 --> 00:28:17,000
Nylander, what's it gonna be?

372
00:28:19,458 --> 00:28:20,958
How long do you need?

373
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:25,541
Captain,
the press is asking for a statement.

374
00:28:25,625 --> 00:28:28,541
- What do I tell them?
- Don't tell them anything.

375
00:28:30,791 --> 00:28:31,958
Guys, listen up.

376
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:39,458
Gustav?

377
00:28:40,791 --> 00:28:41,791
Are you coming?

378
00:28:42,208 --> 00:28:45,416
- We need time to buy sweets as well.
- Yeah. What about Mom?

379
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,666
Mmm...

380
00:28:48,333 --> 00:28:50,833
She couldn't
make it after all, so...

381
00:28:52,875 --> 00:28:54,916
it's a guys' night.

382
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:05,916
- Hi. Sorry to disturb you.
- Hey.

383
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
- Steen Hartung?
- Yes.

384
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:11,666
Yeah. I'm sorry to turn up like this,
but I tried calling a few times.

385
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:15,541
I'm Niels Davidsen, a reporter
from <i>Background</i>. Do you have a comment?

386
00:29:15,625 --> 00:29:16,708
A comment on what?

387
00:29:16,791 --> 00:29:19,375
About the murders of the two women.

388
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,125
There are rumors about some fingerprints.

389
00:29:22,208 --> 00:29:23,458
I haven't heard anything.

390
00:29:23,541 --> 00:29:25,750
Your daughter's fingerprints
were supposedly found

391
00:29:25,833 --> 00:29:27,250
in connection with the murders.

392
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:29,208
We have it from a source in the police.

393
00:29:29,291 --> 00:29:31,531
- I know nothing about...
- Do the prints make you wonder

394
00:29:31,583 --> 00:29:32,875
if she's still alive?

395
00:29:35,416 --> 00:29:38,291
Steen, we would like you
to come on the show tonight.

396
00:29:38,375 --> 00:29:40,625
My son is home.
We are on our way to see a movie.

397
00:29:40,708 --> 00:29:41,916
- Go away.
- Wait a second.

398
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,625
Won't you please...

399
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:00,750
Who was it, Dad?

400
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:05,291
Who was it, Dad?

401
00:30:06,416 --> 00:30:07,583
It was nobody...

402
00:30:21,916 --> 00:30:22,916
Get the glue.

403
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,333
- Where is it?
- I don't know.

404
00:30:25,416 --> 00:30:27,000
Where we keep glue, damn it.

405
00:30:28,333 --> 00:30:30,250
Just get the damn glue!

406
00:30:31,708 --> 00:30:33,125
I'm going to Victor's.

407
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:53,958
- Please move your homework.
- Okay.

408
00:30:55,875 --> 00:30:58,958
- How long will you be gone for tonight?
- We talked about that.

409
00:31:00,666 --> 00:31:02,166
Please set the table.

410
00:31:06,125 --> 00:31:08,791
- You weren't at the lantern party either.
- No.

411
00:31:10,291 --> 00:31:12,833
Why can't Sebastian
be here sometimes?

412
00:31:12,916 --> 00:31:14,416
Because we have Grandpa.

413
00:31:15,041 --> 00:31:18,250
And look, you don't ask him if you can
get your ears pierced. You ask me.

414
00:31:18,333 --> 00:31:20,041
- You listening?
- Hmm.

415
00:31:20,125 --> 00:31:21,708
I think it's a really bad idea.

416
00:31:21,791 --> 00:31:24,750
You can tear the earlobe, and it can...

417
00:31:24,833 --> 00:31:27,208
But I have drawn pictures for Sebastian.

418
00:31:27,291 --> 00:31:29,875
- And you said he could come over.
- Yeah.

419
00:31:29,958 --> 00:31:32,416
But we're not together anymore.

420
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:35,416
We're good friends,
but we're... we're not dating.

421
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:39,958
- Yeah, but he'll still sleep over, right?
- No, not any more. That's over.

422
00:31:41,083 --> 00:31:43,958
- Why did you break up with him?
- It's none of your business.

423
00:31:44,041 --> 00:31:46,958
- Yes, it is!
- No, 'cause that's adult stuff.

424
00:31:47,041 --> 00:31:49,500
- Fuck your adult stuff.
- That's not how we talk here!

425
00:31:50,458 --> 00:31:52,250
How would you know? You're never here.

426
00:31:54,083 --> 00:31:55,833
Would you please let Grandpa in?

427
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:11,125
It's not Grandpa.
It's someone from your crappy job.

428
00:32:13,125 --> 00:32:16,250
Hey. I wanted to look at the floorplan
before we go.

429
00:32:16,333 --> 00:32:17,333
Yeah.

430
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:20,583
- Sorry to interrupt your dinner.
- No, it's fine.

431
00:32:20,666 --> 00:32:22,958
- The place is set for my grandpa.
- Le, enough.

432
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:26,333
- No, I'll just go for...
- No, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait.

433
00:32:28,916 --> 00:32:30,791
- Eat your vegetables.
- Mmm.

434
00:32:33,291 --> 00:32:35,208
- Do you want more?
- No, no thank you.

435
00:32:36,583 --> 00:32:38,125
- It was good, though.
- Mm-hm?

436
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:42,083
You're lying.

437
00:32:43,666 --> 00:32:45,916
Grandpa will be here soon, so get ready.

438
00:32:59,583 --> 00:33:01,416
He is not my real grandpa.

439
00:33:02,333 --> 00:33:05,833
He is just helping my mom,
because she doesn't have a dad or a mom.

440
00:33:05,916 --> 00:33:06,916
I see.

441
00:33:09,208 --> 00:33:10,916
You have different coloured eyes.

442
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:14,291
Uh, yes, yes, I do. Yeah.

443
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,916
Wow. Is that a budgie?

444
00:33:18,916 --> 00:33:20,041
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

445
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:22,541
Do you have kids?

446
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:24,750
No.

447
00:33:26,375 --> 00:33:27,375
A wife?

448
00:33:28,541 --> 00:33:29,541
No.

449
00:33:31,166 --> 00:33:34,833
- You can't keep a relationship either?
- Uh, yes.

450
00:33:35,333 --> 00:33:37,041
But, uh, my wife died.

451
00:33:39,125 --> 00:33:40,708
How did she die?

452
00:33:41,583 --> 00:33:42,583
Ah...

453
00:33:43,125 --> 00:33:45,375
- You don't want to hear about that.
- I do.

454
00:33:51,708 --> 00:33:52,708
Well, she...

455
00:33:56,333 --> 00:33:57,333
She...

456
00:33:57,666 --> 00:34:01,041
There was a fire
in the building we lived in.

457
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:06,833
There was some... We'd just moved in,
and there was some illegal wiring.

458
00:34:07,666 --> 00:34:09,083
I think... Um...

459
00:34:10,875 --> 00:34:13,458
I wasn't home. But, uh, she was.

460
00:34:18,291 --> 00:34:22,000
If our flat caught fire,
I'd run out as fast as I could.

461
00:34:24,375 --> 00:34:25,375
Yeah.

462
00:34:26,291 --> 00:34:27,416
I'm sorry.

463
00:34:29,958 --> 00:34:32,166
- You can watch some TV.
- Okay.

464
00:34:39,375 --> 00:34:42,291
- Should we look at the floorplan?
- Yes, let's do that.

465
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,166
Where does Jessie live?

466
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Right here.

467
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:20,666
<i>Kvium's car
is coming. Englandsvej 7. Over.</i>

468
00:35:36,083 --> 00:35:39,541
<i>Kvium and her daughter
are moving towards East Block 18. Over.</i>

469
00:35:57,958 --> 00:36:01,500
<i>Kvium has arrived at the apartment.
Sixth floor. Hess over.</i>

470
00:36:36,875 --> 00:36:40,166
<i>...daughter Kristine,
who disappeared last fall.</i>

471
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:43,291
<i>Fingerprints have been discovered
that belong to Kristine,</i>

472
00:36:43,375 --> 00:36:46,000
<i>who was presumed killed last year.</i>

473
00:36:46,083 --> 00:36:48,166
<i>The police refuse to make any comments,</i>

474
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:49,875
<i>and say that the case is closed,</i>

475
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:52,059
<i>pointing to the physical evidence...</i>

476
00:36:52,083 --> 00:36:54,208
<i>...and full confession...</i>

477
00:36:57,875 --> 00:37:00,666
- <i>I'm in position.</i>
- Yeah. Everyone's in position.

478
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:03,125
If he turns up, we'll see him immediately.

479
00:37:03,208 --> 00:37:04,291
<i>Shit.</i>

480
00:37:04,375 --> 00:37:05,375
<i>What's up?</i>

481
00:37:05,458 --> 00:37:08,416
<i>- Steen, Kristine's dad</i>. <i>Good evening.</i>
- Steen Hartung's on TV.

482
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,916
<i>- Good evening.
- Kristine's fingerprints</i>

483
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,333
<i>have turned up in two murder cases.</i>

484
00:37:13,416 --> 00:37:15,958
<i>- That must be devastating for you...
- </i>I've just heard...

485
00:37:16,041 --> 00:37:18,375
- Sh!
<i>- Do you think she could be alive?</i>

486
00:37:18,458 --> 00:37:20,333
<i>Yes. I think she might be.</i>

487
00:37:20,916 --> 00:37:25,333
<i>- That must be just horrifying...
- That's why I'd like to tell people.</i>

488
00:37:25,833 --> 00:37:30,250
<i>If you know something, or saw something
that could be connected to our daughter,</i>

489
00:37:30,333 --> 00:37:31,416
<i>please contact the police.</i>

490
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,583
<i>- </i>Where's Vogel?
<i>- It might not be too late.</i>

491
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,958
<i>- And to the person who took Kristine...
- </i>Find him now!

492
00:37:37,041 --> 00:37:41,083
<i>...I have just one plea.
Will you please give her back to us?</i>

493
00:37:41,166 --> 00:37:42,166
<i>Kristine...</i>

494
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:43,809
<i>- </i>When did you arrange this?
- We didn't.

495
00:37:43,833 --> 00:37:45,125
<i>...is a good girl.</i>

496
00:37:45,208 --> 00:37:47,875
<i>- She didn't deserve this.</i>
- There will be repercussions.

497
00:37:47,958 --> 00:37:51,333
- You know that, right?
<i>- Kristine deserves to be with her friends,</i>

498
00:37:51,416 --> 00:37:53,291
<i>and go to school.</i>

499
00:37:54,166 --> 00:37:57,833
<i>She deserves to be with her family,
she deserves to get back to life.</i>

500
00:37:57,916 --> 00:38:00,601
- Rosa, the minister of justice.
<i>- If Kristine's watching,</i>

501
00:38:00,625 --> 00:38:03,041
<i>- what would you like to say to her?
- We miss you.</i>

502
00:38:07,708 --> 00:38:09,708
<i>We won't give up until we find you.</i>

503
00:38:31,875 --> 00:38:32,875
Where's Gustav?

504
00:38:33,833 --> 00:38:34,833
He's sleeping.

505
00:38:35,916 --> 00:38:37,083
He's devastated.

506
00:38:45,083 --> 00:38:46,083
I didn't mean to...

507
00:38:46,125 --> 00:38:49,791
Most nights, I can't sleep, because I...
I think I hear her in her room.

508
00:38:50,875 --> 00:38:52,916
When I look out of the window, I...

509
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,166
I see her sitting
on the swing in the yard.

510
00:38:57,125 --> 00:38:59,416
I hear her laughter in the car.

511
00:39:00,583 --> 00:39:03,291
I can still feel her warm hands
in mine at the hospital

512
00:39:03,375 --> 00:39:05,041
that time she had appendicitis.

513
00:39:09,083 --> 00:39:10,166
Ah, Rosa.

514
00:39:12,625 --> 00:39:14,625
I would never have done this...

515
00:39:16,791 --> 00:39:19,416
if I didn't believe it with all my heart.

516
00:39:26,166 --> 00:39:27,333
I can feel her. I...

517
00:39:28,541 --> 00:39:30,166
I know she's out there.

518
00:39:38,041 --> 00:39:39,041
Honey.

519
00:39:40,583 --> 00:39:43,333
Honey<i>...</i> can't you feel her too?

520
00:40:10,583 --> 00:40:13,958
<i>Entrance B, entrance C, check. Moving on.</i>

521
00:40:33,625 --> 00:40:35,333
- <i>What's up?</i>
- What's going on?

522
00:40:35,416 --> 00:40:38,250
- Why did you turn off the light?
<i>- I figured Jessie'd go to bed now.</i>

523
00:40:39,791 --> 00:40:41,500
What's happening at your end?

524
00:40:42,833 --> 00:40:44,333
Really not that much.

525
00:40:45,541 --> 00:40:48,541
He might not even strike tonight.

526
00:40:50,333 --> 00:40:52,166
We'll look like idiots.

527
00:40:52,791 --> 00:40:56,041
- Well, mostly you. It was your idea.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

528
00:41:01,583 --> 00:41:03,125
<i>- By the way, um...</i>
- Yes?

529
00:41:04,541 --> 00:41:05,625
I'm, uh...

530
00:41:07,291 --> 00:41:09,166
I'm sorry about your wife.

531
00:41:14,375 --> 00:41:17,416
- Your daughter's pretty bright, huh?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

532
00:41:18,666 --> 00:41:22,500
<i>She takes all the credit.
And her grandpa, of course.</i>

533
00:41:24,375 --> 00:41:28,625
- She told me he helps out sometimes.
- <i>Yeah. You can say that again.</i>

534
00:41:30,125 --> 00:41:33,625
It started with Aksel and his wife
taking care of me a long time ago.

535
00:41:34,583 --> 00:41:37,750
<i>- Why?</i>
- I was in some trouble, and, uh<i>...</i>

536
00:41:39,333 --> 00:41:41,833
Since then, he's just been there for us.

537
00:41:45,791 --> 00:41:50,666
- And what about her... her dad?
<i>- He's not really worth mentioning.</i>

538
00:41:53,083 --> 00:41:55,250
That's why I want to go to cyber crime.

539
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:01,375
<i>- To have more time?
- </i>Yeah.

540
00:42:01,958 --> 00:42:04,416
And I just get too many nightmares
and too little sleep.

541
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:05,916
It's hard to keep it all up.

542
00:42:06,833 --> 00:42:10,500
<i>Yes, but it's also
what makes you good at it.</i>

543
00:42:10,583 --> 00:42:12,041
Maybe.

544
00:42:13,583 --> 00:42:18,041
<i>The male with the cigarette
from earlier is approaching the entrance.</i>

545
00:42:19,583 --> 00:42:21,958
<i>Do you have
a description of him? Over.</i>

546
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:26,291
<i>No, he's wearing a hood.
Medium height, slim. Over.</i>

547
00:42:28,083 --> 00:42:29,166
Hess, what's happening?

548
00:42:33,958 --> 00:42:36,666
<i>Someone just sneaked in.
Switch to radio.</i>

549
00:42:37,375 --> 00:42:38,416
What...

550
00:42:39,791 --> 00:42:42,375
<i>Bravo, can you tell if he's armed?
Jansen, over.</i>

551
00:42:50,625 --> 00:42:52,750
<i>Fourth floor. Bravo, over.</i>

552
00:43:03,666 --> 00:43:05,375
<i>Fifth floor. Bravo, over.</i>

553
00:43:08,375 --> 00:43:10,291
Thulin, he's on your floor. Over.

554
00:43:15,708 --> 00:43:17,875
<i>He's walked past the apartment.
Hess, over.</i>

555
00:43:36,541 --> 00:43:39,458
<i>Okay, he's going back.
Team Bravo, stand by. Hess, over.</i>

556
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,125
<i>Green light, Bravo.</i>

557
00:44:03,916 --> 00:44:06,291
<i>On the ground.
On the ground! Hands, hands!</i>

558
00:44:09,208 --> 00:44:12,291
<i>- </i>Don't move!
- What are you doing? Let go of me!

559
00:44:12,375 --> 00:44:15,291
Ah! I haven't done anything. Let go of me.

560
00:44:15,375 --> 00:44:17,208
Nikolaj Møller, Mantuavej 76.

561
00:44:18,083 --> 00:44:20,083
- What are you doing?
- I wanted to talk to Jessie.

562
00:44:20,125 --> 00:44:21,208
About what?

563
00:44:21,291 --> 00:44:23,051
- She sent me a text...
- What text?

564
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:25,250
PIN?

565
00:44:26,083 --> 00:44:27,583
- Mobile PIN number!
- 2003.

566
00:44:28,333 --> 00:44:29,791
What the hell?

567
00:44:30,666 --> 00:44:33,291
"Get over here now,
or I'll send these to your wife."

568
00:44:33,375 --> 00:44:35,083
I was to meet her.
She was blackmailing me.

569
00:44:35,166 --> 00:44:37,006
- Only wanted to scare her.
- Shut the fuck up.

570
00:44:43,666 --> 00:44:44,916
Who filmed it?

571
00:44:46,125 --> 00:44:48,125
The text was sent from a hidden number.

572
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:49,750
Half an hour ago.

573
00:44:50,791 --> 00:44:55,083
- Who's with Jessie?
- Ricks. In a holiday rental she uses.

574
00:45:01,541 --> 00:45:03,625
What's up?

575
00:45:03,708 --> 00:45:05,333
Can we please go home?

576
00:45:05,416 --> 00:45:06,416
No.

577
00:45:09,875 --> 00:45:10,875
Go to bed.

578
00:45:12,833 --> 00:45:15,708
- Where's the other detective?
- He went to get some pizza.

579
00:45:17,416 --> 00:45:20,125
In the meantime, you're just kicking it
on Pornhub, or what?

580
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:27,041
So what if I was?

581
00:45:31,333 --> 00:45:32,166
What the fuck?

582
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:37,250
Stay here.

583
00:46:35,583 --> 00:46:36,583
Hello?

584
00:46:39,791 --> 00:46:40,791
Where are you?

585
00:46:50,458 --> 00:46:51,625
Someone there?

586
00:47:07,958 --> 00:47:09,833
Olivia?

587
00:47:10,916 --> 00:47:11,750
Sweetie?

588
00:47:38,333 --> 00:47:39,708
Mummy?

589
00:47:41,333 --> 00:47:43,083
Mummy!

590
00:47:43,791 --> 00:47:45,333
Mummy, I'm thirsty.

591
00:47:47,958 --> 00:47:48,958
Jessie!

592
00:47:50,291 --> 00:47:51,375
- Jessie!
- Hi, Olivia.

593
00:47:51,458 --> 00:47:54,458
Whoa, whoa. Calm down, don't be scared.
I'm Mark. I'm with the police.

594
00:47:54,541 --> 00:47:55,625
We're looking for your mom.

595
00:47:55,708 --> 00:47:57,000
- Do you know where she is?
- No.

596
00:47:57,083 --> 00:47:58,083
Jansen?

597
00:47:59,333 --> 00:48:00,333
Ricks.

598
00:48:01,708 --> 00:48:03,833
Ah, for fuck's sake!

599
00:48:06,583 --> 00:48:07,416
Ambulance!

600
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:09,333
No, no, no<i>...</i>

601
00:48:12,541 --> 00:48:13,541
Jessie!

602
00:48:19,375 --> 00:48:20,375
Hess.

603
00:48:48,791 --> 00:48:51,875
There's no pulse. Let's get the others.

604
00:48:55,458 --> 00:48:56,916
Hess.

605
00:48:58,333 --> 00:48:59,333
Hess!

606
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:02,958
Jansen, over here.
