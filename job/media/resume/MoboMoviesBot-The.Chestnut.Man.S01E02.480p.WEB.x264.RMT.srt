<i>- It's Genz.</i>
- It's Hess.

3
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,000
<i>Okay?</i>

4
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,541
- I need a login to the video archive.
<i>- Okay?</i>

5
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:22,958
l need access to the Hartung case.

6
00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:24,666
<i>I thought you were working with Thulin</i>

7
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,110
<i>on the case about the woman
whose hand was cut off in Husum?</i>

8
00:00:27,166 --> 00:00:29,291
I am. When can I have that login?

9
00:00:29,791 --> 00:00:31,791
<i>- Uh... I'll send it straightaway.</i>
- Thanks.

10
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:39,625
<i>This is the video interview
of Linus Bekker</i>

11
00:00:39,708 --> 00:00:42,791
<i>in connection with the murder
of Kristine Hartung.</i>

12
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:45,666
<i>Detectives Martin Ricks
and Tim Jansen are present</i>

13
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,250
<i>as well as the barrister
representing the accused.</i>

14
00:00:49,708 --> 00:00:51,583
<i>Linus? In your own words,</i>

15
00:00:51,666 --> 00:00:54,375
<i>can you tell us what happened
on Wednesday the 8th of June?</i>

16
00:00:54,458 --> 00:00:56,291
<i>Just in your own words.</i>

17
00:00:56,375 --> 00:01:00,583
<i>It was one of those nights I was feeling
restless, so I went for a drive.</i>

18
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:02,708
<i>That's when I saw her.</i>

19
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:07,458
<i>The girl. She was walking with her bike.</i>

20
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:11,291
<i>We would like to know
how you disposed of the corpse.</i>

21
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:12,375
<i>Can you tell us?</i>

22
00:01:12,458 --> 00:01:16,916
I drove out north.
I had the machete in the car.

23
00:01:17,416 --> 00:01:18,958
<i>I cut her up</i>

24
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,041
<i>and then I buried her in the woods.</i>

25
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:23,875
<i>Can you show us where?</i>

26
00:01:27,375 --> 00:01:29,333
<i>I don't really remember.</i>

27
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:32,750
<i>I don't remember exactly where.</i>

28
00:01:47,791 --> 00:01:50,875
Here you go.
Remember to eat your fruit, okay.

29
00:01:51,375 --> 00:01:53,125
Off you go.

30
00:01:53,208 --> 00:01:55,041
I have a tummy ache.

31
00:01:58,166 --> 00:02:02,333
Listen, honey.
It was just an argument. Hmm?

32
00:02:02,416 --> 00:02:04,416
No one is upset.

33
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:06,875
Okay?

34
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Good.

35
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:14,208
Have a great day, sweetie.

36
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:39,666
Hi, Mom.

37
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,250
<i>Are you alone? Can you talk?</i>

38
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:44,875
- Yeah, they just left.
<i>- You've made the right decision, Anne.</i>

39
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:47,541
Well, it wasn't an easy decision to make.

40
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:50,375
<i>I understand,
but it's the right thing to do.</i>

41
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:53,583
<i>I don't know what happened,
but the most important thing</i>

42
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:55,666
<i>is that you think of yourself
and the girls.</i>

43
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,000
Yeah, I know, Mom.

44
00:02:58,083 --> 00:03:01,166
- All right. See you this afternoon.
<i>- Pack your things, and the girls'.</i>

45
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,333
I'll have mine and their things
packed by then.

46
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:06,958
<i>I love you, Anne. You're not alone, okay?</i>

47
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:08,833
I love you too.

48
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:14,916
THE CHESTNUT MAN

49
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:20,458
MONDAY, 12 OCTOBER

50
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:24,833
Unfortunately, no one can confirm that
you stayed at the motel on Monday evening.

51
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:29,416
And no one saw your car in the parking lot
until seven o'clock the next morning.

52
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,333
You've detained my client
for 48 hours.

53
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:34,875
He maintains
that he stayed there all night,

54
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:37,166
and that he has
no involvement in the crime.

55
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,125
So unless you have new information...

56
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:43,875
Laura had the locks changed in your house
without your knowledge. Why was that?

57
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:45,708
I've told you.

58
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,625
Magnus must have lost his keys again.

59
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:51,708
Right. Or maybe she wanted
to end your relationship.

60
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:56,958
We know she called you that night.
So what did she want to talk to you about?

61
00:04:57,916 --> 00:04:59,458
Did she want to break up?

62
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:02,750
- You've already asked that.
- That must... it must have been tough.

63
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:05,416
After everything you've done
for her and the boy.

64
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,250
I mean, it would be natural
for you to drive back to talk to her.

65
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:13,208
- I did not go back.
- But she insisted that it was over.

66
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:17,333
That you had to move out, and you couldn't
see Magnus again. So you lost it.

67
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:19,184
- Not true.
- You cut off her left hand

68
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:22,375
- because she wore your ring on it.
- Stop this. You stop right there.

69
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:24,333
You can't detain my client any longer.

70
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:26,208
He'd like to go home and see the boy

71
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:28,750
- who is going to be released...
- Yes, please.

72
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:33,333
One last question.

73
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,916
Do you recognize this?

74
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:40,875
No.

75
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:43,291
All right. We're leaving.

76
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:45,958
- Uh...
- Yeah, um...

77
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:49,708
My client agrees that
you have to conduct the investigation,

78
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:51,583
but when will you relinquish his house?

79
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:54,083
The house will be closed off
until we're done,

80
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:56,625
so he'll need to be patient
a little longer.

81
00:05:57,125 --> 00:06:00,250
- We'll keep in touch. Thank you.
- Thank you.

82
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:17,208
Abildgård,
did you find any photos of Hauge's car?

83
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:18,291
No.

84
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,250
There has to be something
on the traffic surveillance

85
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:25,000
- between Roskilde and Husum that night.
- There are lots of cars on that road.

86
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:29,291
Yeah, I know, but I'm only asking you
to find one car, right?

87
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,375
Just one car.

88
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:33,625
Hey. There is something
I want to show you.

89
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:38,208
- You haven't been here for days.
- No, I've been reading up on osteology.

90
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:41,458
Okay, you've been reading up about bones?

91
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:45,208
Yeah. Follow me.
I've got the car running outside.

92
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:56,291
Uh, what... what the hell is he doing?

93
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:58,750
- Wasn't he going back to Europol?
- I really don't know.

94
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:07,625
- I was reading about the Hartung case.
- The Hartung case?

95
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:11,000
Have you... Before we begin,
I need to know I can trust you.

96
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:14,375
I'm serious.

97
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:19,083
If it doesn't take all day, and it's
within the boundaries of the law, you can.

98
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:22,166
According to the pathologist's report,

99
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:26,791
Linus Bekker killed and dismembered
Kristine Hartung with a machete.

100
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:27,750
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

101
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:30,875
But he confessed,
and the evidence was overwhelming.

102
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:33,541
Yeah, the murder weapon
was found in his garage,

103
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:37,166
and the pathologist found the victim's
blood on it with 100% certainty.

104
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:41,458
Yeah, but something was missing.
I've brought an identical machete. And...

105
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:44,041
- What the hell is that?
- Could you take that end?

106
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:45,708
- You do it.
- Come on.

107
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:46,958
- What, me?
- Yeah.

108
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:48,250
Why-why... why me?

109
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:52,166
Yeah. Yes... Okay.

110
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,500
How about
we do something later? Together?

111
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:04,000
Mom's negotiations are sure to drag on.

112
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:05,083
Like what?

113
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:06,875
I don't know.

114
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:09,208
Something... fun?

115
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:11,583
Mm-hm.

116
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,375
Why did the police come by
the other day?

117
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:20,708
Uh... Did Mom tell you?

118
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
No. I saw them.

119
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:28,166
Well, it was nothing.
It was just a misunderstanding.

120
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,250
So it wasn't about...

121
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:33,041
No.

122
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:35,125
Okay.

123
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:39,000
- I love you.
- Sure.

124
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:41,291
Bye.

125
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,375
Watch where you're going!

126
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,250
Mathilde?

127
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:12,958
Hey.

128
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:14,625
Hey.

129
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:16,291
How are you?

130
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:18,791
I'm fine.

131
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:21,416
I just wanted to ask you...

132
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:27,416
Last fall, when you and Kristine
made those chestnut men at our house,

133
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:29,333
can you tell me about that?

134
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,708
- Chestnut men?
- Yeah.

135
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:34,041
- Did you make them, or was it...
- Uh...

136
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:36,833
- Was it her?
- Well, we both did, I think.

137
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:39,291
And then what... what did you do with them?

138
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:41,000
- We sold them.
- To whom?

139
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:43,375
To people you knew, or passers by? Or...

140
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,125
I don't know. I don't know.

141
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:48,583
You don't know? You must remember
who you sold them to?

142
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:50,208
- Uh...
- Come on!

143
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:53,125
- We... we didn't know them.
- Are you completely sure?

144
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:55,833
- Mathilde, it's important.
- I have to go.

145
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:57,500
I'm sorry. Sorry.

146
00:09:58,708 --> 00:09:59,875
I apologize.

147
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:05,041
I really didn't mean to...

148
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:11,333
We miss you.

149
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:15,833
I miss you too.

150
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:19,458
And her. Sorry, I can't...

151
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:24,833
Wait! Was it last year?

152
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:26,958
Yeah.

153
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:28,833
Uh...

154
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:30,958
We didn't make chestnut men last year.

155
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:33,708
Well, we thought it was childish.

156
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:45,250
The truth is,
we haven't done enough for children

157
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:47,000
during our time in power.

158
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:50,250
But that's over now.
I suggest, with the help from your party,

159
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:52,833
to commit more resources to early action,

160
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:55,316
which we know makes all the difference.

161
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:58,791
We need more social workers
at day care centers,

162
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:03,083
and we need to improve
our childcare workers' ability

163
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:05,583
to spot children faring badly earlier

164
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:08,875
- Gert? Am I boring you?
- Not at all.

165
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:10,875
But you've said it all before.

166
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:13,750
Yes, I said it
at last year's negotiations.

167
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:16,875
But we weren't able to secure
the funds needed to accomplish

168
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:20,875
Rosa, I like you.

169
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:24,375
And I sympathize with you and your loss.

170
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:29,375
But it seems as though the prime minister
is taking advantage of your situation,

171
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:31,041
and that makes me feel sick.

172
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:33,958
- Bukke, I think we should...
- I'm not sure I follow you here.

173
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:37,875
While you were away,
the ruling party have been polling poorly.

174
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:42,333
The prime minister is treating
the budget negotiations like a goody bag,

175
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:45,541
using her most popular minister
to play Santa

176
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:49,250
in order to reclaim votes
before the election.

177
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:52,791
This has always been my platform.

178
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:55,166
It has nothing to do
with political pandering.

179
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,625
Right, if you say so.

180
00:11:56,708 --> 00:12:00,125
But if you think what we're offering
is a "goody bag", let's talk about that.

181
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:04,041
- Good. If we were to offer-
- We're not offering anything, Frederik.

182
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:08,333
I think we should let Bukke talk it over
with his party.

183
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:11,416
Please excuse me.

184
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:18,416
If Bukke is putting on the pressure,
we have to do the same.

185
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:22,333
We, uh... we need to do interviews.

186
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:25,166
Today, and throughout the week.
As many as possible.

187
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:28,500
- You sure that's wise?
- We need to make our social policy heard.

188
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,458
That way, we'll force Bukke
into supporting us.

189
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:33,625
Then he'll appear weak and indecisive.

190
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:36,500
Well, you know they won't just ask you
about politics?

191
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,166
I'm not afraid of that.

192
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:44,083
Good, but we'll have to control it, then.

193
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:47,458
We need a strategy
or it's all going to revolve around...

194
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:53,583
Well, how much you miss Kristine.
How tough it is, and how often you cry.

195
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:57,583
You can't have it shift attention
away from your political message.

196
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:10,083
I was ordering a sandwich.
I was gone for five minutes, max.

197
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,375
Who would write
something like that?

198
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:15,166
MURDERER

199
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,125
I'm calling the security services.

200
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:25,833
Hess. Hess!

201
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:28,291
Can you please explain
the deal with the pig?

202
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:33,708
Look, I have a staff meeting
in three minutes.

203
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:37,458
Okay. Sure.

204
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:39,750
I just need to clean this.

205
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:49,708
In terms of bone thickness and density,
the pig matches a 12-year-old, right?

206
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:53,625
Yeah, I... I guess...
I mean, what's the point of all this?

207
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:57,541
Hess?

208
00:13:58,125 --> 00:13:59,500
Yeah.

209
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:02,666
- Do you have a microscope I could borrow?
- Yeah.

210
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,458
When you cut through bone,

211
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:09,625
microscopic dust is left
in the crevices on the weapon

212
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:12,541
which is almost impossible to remove.

213
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:15,666
Yeah, unless you scrub it
thoroughly,

214
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:18,666
- like Linus Bekker said he did.
- Yeah, and like I just did.

215
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:20,166
Take a look.

216
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:21,916
Yeah.

217
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:30,250
Okay.

218
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:34,916
That's pretty interesting.

219
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,458
There's bone dust. So what?

220
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:39,750
Well, forensic analysis
of the weapon

221
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:43,958
showed traces of Kristine Hartung's blood,
but no traces of bone residue.

222
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:49,083
Uh... so it's possible
that Bekker didn't dismember her?

223
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:50,000
- Yeah.
- Or what?

224
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:53,166
It sure is strange
that the machete had no bone dust.

225
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,208
But Linus Bekker
confessed to the killing.

226
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:57,625
The blood on the machete
that was found in his garage

227
00:14:57,708 --> 00:15:00,750
was from Kristine Hartung,
so either way, he killed her.

228
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:01,666
Genz?

229
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,541
- Yeah?
- We have to get going.

230
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,000
- Excuse me, they're calling for me.
- Okay.

231
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:19,250
Why couldn't Linus Bekker identify
the places where he buried the body parts?

232
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:22,666
He's a diagnosed schizophrenic.

233
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,416
He's a multiple sex offender.

234
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,083
He confessed and was convicted.

235
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:32,791
I just don't see how this connects
to the murder of Laura Kjær.

236
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:36,750
Apart from the chestnut man with Kristine
Hartung's fingerprints found by her body.

237
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:40,708
- Thulin?
- Yeah?

238
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:43,041
A message was sent
to Laura Kjær's cellphone.

239
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,833
- What message?
- I don't know what to make of it.

240
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:50,083
We normally cancel victims'
phone subscriptions when we are done,

241
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:51,541
but this came in.

242
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:56,166
<i>♪ Chestnut man ♪</i>

243
00:15:56,250 --> 00:16:00,875
<i>♪ Come on inside

244
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:05,666
<i>♪ Come on inside

245
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:09,500
<i>- ♪ For me today... ♪
- </i>Who sent it?

246
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:12,458
The number is hidden,
but it came from the city.

247
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:14,833
- <i>♪ Chestnut man... ♪</i>
- When was it sent?

248
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:17,291
Earlier today.
We just saw it now.

249
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:19,625
<i>♪ Chestnut man... ♪</i>

250
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:24,416
No one apart from us and the Hartungs
know about the chestnut man.

251
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:28,250
- How much time do you need to track it?
- I'll get right on it.

252
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:33,083
<i>♪ Do you have some chestnuts
For me today? ♪</i>

253
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:41,750
I acted like an idiot,
honey. I'm... I'm sorry.

254
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:44,791
It won't happen again. I promise.

255
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:49,208
I called that couple's counselor
and made an appointment for the two of us.

256
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:52,791
I love you and I love the kids.
I can't live without you.

257
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:56,166
Could you please call me
when you get this message?

258
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,541
Okay. Thank you. Bye-bye, honey.

259
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:41,916
Come here, you. Come on!

260
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:45,500
- Phone. Your phone.
- What's going on?

261
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:47,250
Yeah. We've got him. Yeah.

262
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,000
I got it.

263
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:52,250
Laura Kjær, 37 years old, dental nurse.

264
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:53,958
You've sent her an audio file.

265
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:55,625
<i>Suspect is found...</i>

266
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:59,666
I have no idea what you're on about.
I don't know any Laura Kjær.

267
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:04,000
The audio file isn't there. But lots
of pictures of women. Who are they?

268
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:07,166
No one I know.

269
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,666
So you like to take pictures
of random women?

270
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,833
I'm happily married.

271
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:14,458
- It's not like you think.
- What about the message to Kjær?

272
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:16,500
Does he have another phone?

273
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,590
I don't have any other phones.

274
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,875
What the hell do you think you're doing?

275
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:26,958
I haven't done anything wrong,
and you're throwing accusations around.

276
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:29,750
We've traced the audio file
to your cellphone.

277
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:38,083
This is from Laura Kjær.
Why do you have a package from her?

278
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:41,166
- What's in it?
- I got a text about a package,

279
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,458
and I... I just picked it up.

280
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:45,500
Hey! That's private.
You... you can't open it.

281
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:51,583
Jesus Christ!

282
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:53,708
Let me out.

283
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:57,750
Let me out. Let me the fuck out.

284
00:18:57,833 --> 00:19:00,375
Thulin here.
We need a technician at Lima 2.

285
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:08,125
You need to think really, really hard.

286
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:12,083
Laura Kjær. How do you know her?

287
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:16,208
- I don't know her. I told you.
- Where were you Monday evening?

288
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:18,392
- What?
- Where were you last Monday?

289
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:19,416
Where is your wife?

290
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,375
- My wife? Why?
- Where is she?

291
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:23,500
- Why are you asking?
- Your wife, where is she?

292
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:26,541
She's at home. What the hell is going on?
What's happened?

293
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:02,541
Hello?

294
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:05,083
Hello?

295
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:30,125
- No one's home.
- I'll check upstairs.

296
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,958
There are signs of struggle
in the bedroom.

297
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:35,916
The garden door was open when we arrived.

298
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,458
But we haven't had time
to search the area.

299
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:43,375
Hess!

300
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:47,125
Report Anne Sejer-Lassen missing.
Check her phone signal.

301
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:49,791
Ask the neighbors
if they saw or heard anything.

302
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,875
We need a canine unit.

303
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:14,583
Call for the dogs.

304
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:34,750
Anne?

305
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:12,708
Hess!

306
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:18,916
Hess!

307
00:23:05,625 --> 00:23:08,125
But why would
someone write "murderer"?

308
00:23:08,208 --> 00:23:10,583
<i>Security services
are asking the same.</i>

309
00:23:10,666 --> 00:23:13,833
We'll have to talk about it tomorrow,
Engells. I have to go now.

310
00:23:13,916 --> 00:23:15,083
- Bye.
<i>- Of course. Bye.</i>

311
00:23:15,166 --> 00:23:16,916
<i>You're
a minority government.</i>

312
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,916
<i>How certain are you that
your other parties will back you?</i>

313
00:23:21,375 --> 00:23:24,416
<i>Our parties work very well
and closely together,</i>

314
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:29,291
<i>so I can't imagine Gert Bukke won't
help us make room in the budget for this.</i>

315
00:23:30,458 --> 00:23:32,333
<i>Now that I've got you...</i>

316
00:23:32,416 --> 00:23:36,583
<i>After everything you've been through,
how tough is it to go back to work?</i>

317
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:39,375
<i>I'm not the same person
I was before.</i>

318
00:23:39,458 --> 00:23:44,791
<i>My husband and I have made the decision
that we need to go on with our lives.</i>

319
00:23:44,875 --> 00:23:47,833
<i>We need to, for the sake of our son,
and for our own sakes.</i>

320
00:23:48,833 --> 00:23:52,833
<i>It helps me to take on responsibility
that goes beyond my family.</i>

321
00:23:52,916 --> 00:23:54,208
<i>But...</i>

322
00:23:57,708 --> 00:23:59,208
Be careful not to burn it.

323
00:24:00,625 --> 00:24:03,250
You were good. You're doing well.

324
00:24:03,333 --> 00:24:05,500
Does it make you mad at me to see that?

325
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:07,916
What do you mean?

326
00:24:08,833 --> 00:24:10,958
That I'm even able to talk about it.

327
00:24:12,375 --> 00:24:15,000
No. And don't be mad at yourself, either.

328
00:24:17,083 --> 00:24:18,916
You called earlier. Why?

329
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:22,416
I met Mathilde at the school this morning.

330
00:24:22,958 --> 00:24:24,250
Mm? How was she?

331
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,583
We were mistaken.

332
00:24:28,291 --> 00:24:30,375
They didn't make chestnut men last year.

333
00:24:30,916 --> 00:24:33,666
I see. It must have been
the year before, then.

334
00:24:36,166 --> 00:24:39,375
- Uh, are we out of ketchup?
- Do you understand what I'm saying?

335
00:24:40,125 --> 00:24:41,875
How can Kristine's fingerprints show up

336
00:24:41,958 --> 00:24:44,875
- on a crime scene in Husum...
- Steen, stop! Don't go there.

337
00:24:44,958 --> 00:24:46,333
We can't take it anymore.

338
00:24:48,166 --> 00:24:52,625
- Gustav, dinner's ready!
- Why is it that I can't go there?

339
00:24:52,708 --> 00:24:54,000
- It's strange...
- Don't. Don't.

340
00:24:54,083 --> 00:24:55,684
- I'm trying...
- It won't get you anywhere.

341
00:24:55,708 --> 00:24:57,791
- I'm trying to...
- Steen, she's dead.

342
00:25:03,375 --> 00:25:06,416
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing, darling.

343
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:10,041
- Do you want a soda? Go get one.
- No, thanks.

344
00:25:10,625 --> 00:25:12,750
- I don't feel like it.
- Okay.

345
00:25:14,416 --> 00:25:18,250
Hey! It was your job to set the table.
I totally forgot. Get to it!

346
00:25:23,041 --> 00:25:26,541
- How was tennis practice?
- It was fine.

347
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:28,791
- Hmm?
- Henrik was out sick.

348
00:25:30,083 --> 00:25:32,958
- Oh, okay.
- So we just took it easy.

349
00:25:33,041 --> 00:25:34,375
Yeah, cool.

350
00:25:35,083 --> 00:25:37,708
So, what? You thrashed him, or what?

351
00:25:41,291 --> 00:25:44,458
And then we found another
chestnut man at the house.

352
00:25:44,541 --> 00:25:46,166
Nobody saw anything?

353
00:25:47,625 --> 00:25:50,833
- Dog walkers, joggers, anyone?
- We're looking into it.

354
00:25:52,333 --> 00:25:54,666
Thomsen and Kragh, you stay at the house.

355
00:25:55,916 --> 00:25:58,583
Abildgård, you talk
to the forester when he arrives.

356
00:25:58,666 --> 00:26:00,833
- Over.
<i>- I will. He's here now. Over.</i>

357
00:26:01,333 --> 00:26:04,666
We're searching the area
and the crime scene up to the main road.

358
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:06,750
<i>It's getting dark. Hurry up.</i>

359
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:09,490
I guess you want to know about this
before anything else?

360
00:26:09,541 --> 00:26:10,458
- Yes.
- I'll hurry.

361
00:26:10,541 --> 00:26:12,208
<i>Charlie 5 is on their way.</i>

362
00:26:13,333 --> 00:26:15,541
<i>We're setting up a perimeter
along the road.</i>

363
00:26:16,458 --> 00:26:18,250
<i>Forensics are coming through.</i>

364
00:27:37,333 --> 00:27:39,791
- I saw the news last night.
- Mmm?

365
00:27:41,625 --> 00:27:44,250
Are you sure you're right for this job?

366
00:27:46,916 --> 00:27:50,000
Yeah. That's the problem.

367
00:28:02,166 --> 00:28:03,250
Thanks.

368
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:09,375
Don't forget the Halloween party
tonight at Le's school.

369
00:28:15,583 --> 00:28:19,541
LANTERN FESTIVAL AT THE SCHOOL

370
00:28:32,166 --> 00:28:34,375
<i>Good morning.</i>

371
00:28:35,125 --> 00:28:38,875
Have you heard about all the new
trash cans that can be used for recycling?

372
00:28:39,416 --> 00:28:42,000
Plastic, metal, biowaste...

373
00:28:44,583 --> 00:28:46,583
- What time is it?
- What the hell? You in a rut?

374
00:28:46,666 --> 00:28:49,083
- Please don't touch that.
- Hey, buddy. Over here.

375
00:28:50,083 --> 00:28:53,541
You better do something about the floors,
if you want to sell fast.

376
00:28:53,625 --> 00:28:55,500
Where the hell is my phone?

377
00:28:57,166 --> 00:29:00,625
We happen to have a floor sander
in the basement. I can bring it up.

378
00:29:02,208 --> 00:29:04,166
And if you need a real estate agent,

379
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:07,875
like I said, my, uh...
friend is great with properties.

380
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:14,583
- That's great.
- Bad news?

381
00:29:15,916 --> 00:29:17,291
TUESDAY, 13 OCTOBER

382
00:29:17,375 --> 00:29:21,750
Both victims were in their 30s,
and they were attacked in their homes.

383
00:29:21,833 --> 00:29:25,791
Preliminary investigations suggest
death by blunt weapon

384
00:29:25,875 --> 00:29:29,000
that pierced through the eye,
impacting the brain.

385
00:29:29,083 --> 00:29:32,041
The first victim had
her left hand sawn off.

386
00:29:32,666 --> 00:29:36,125
The second victim had
both left and right hands sawn off.

387
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:40,625
Presumably with a battery-powered saw,
but we're looking into the various models.

388
00:29:41,166 --> 00:29:42,541
The phone found in the package

389
00:29:42,625 --> 00:29:44,916
that was used to send a text
to Laura Kjær's phone?

390
00:29:45,666 --> 00:29:46,541
What do we know?

391
00:29:46,625 --> 00:29:49,041
Well, it had an anonymous
prepaid calling card.

392
00:29:49,791 --> 00:29:52,875
The serial number was burned off,
so we can't track it either.

393
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:56,041
- Who sent the package?
- Laura Kjær is listed as sender.

394
00:29:56,125 --> 00:30:00,583
The killer placed the package with
Laura's hand and phone at her doorstep,

395
00:30:00,666 --> 00:30:02,708
where it was picked up by a delivery man.

396
00:30:02,791 --> 00:30:04,250
Our initial, um...

397
00:30:05,166 --> 00:30:10,541
Our initial suspect was
Laura Kjær's boyfriend, Hans Henrik Hauge.

398
00:30:11,125 --> 00:30:14,583
But it looks like
he met with his lawyer last night.

399
00:30:14,666 --> 00:30:16,541
So, we have nothing?

400
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,166
There's nothing
to connect the victims

401
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:24,083
apart from
two chestnut men with fingerprints.

402
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:29,125
In both cases, we found a chestnut man
close to the scene of the crime.

403
00:30:29,625 --> 00:30:33,041
And both these chestnut men
were provided with a fingerprint

404
00:30:33,625 --> 00:30:36,583
which, according to
dactyloscopic analysis,

405
00:30:36,666 --> 00:30:38,208
is identical...

406
00:30:39,875 --> 00:30:41,666
to Kristine Hartung's fingerprints.

407
00:30:42,375 --> 00:30:43,250
What?

408
00:30:47,083 --> 00:30:49,041
Hey, guys, guys, guys. Calm down.

409
00:30:49,125 --> 00:30:50,541
This is all we know so far.

410
00:30:50,625 --> 00:30:54,000
The fingerprints may well turn out
to be irrelevant to the case.

411
00:30:55,041 --> 00:30:57,041
How old are the chestnuts?

412
00:30:57,916 --> 00:30:59,666
It can't be said with certainty.

413
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:02,541
According to the analysis, they could be
anywhere from a few weeks

414
00:31:02,625 --> 00:31:05,083
to over a year old,
depending on how they've been stored.

415
00:31:05,166 --> 00:31:07,250
I know this is something
that affects us all.

416
00:31:07,333 --> 00:31:10,083
But I have to remind you
that this is strictly confidential...

417
00:31:10,166 --> 00:31:12,208
We have to reopen the Hartung case.

418
00:31:12,291 --> 00:31:14,583
One print could be a coincidence,
but not two.

419
00:31:14,666 --> 00:31:19,416
If they are Kristine's, our conclusions
about her disappearance may be wrong.

420
00:31:21,291 --> 00:31:23,291
You're saying we're not doing our jobs?

421
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:27,166
No, no, I'm not. This isn't personal.

422
00:31:27,666 --> 00:31:29,375
I'm not personally offended.

423
00:31:29,458 --> 00:31:33,958
It's just... weird to take criticism
from someone who just walked in,

424
00:31:34,041 --> 00:31:35,791
because he fucked up in The Hague.

425
00:31:40,625 --> 00:31:43,625
Hess, do you know
how many resources we put on that case?

426
00:31:43,708 --> 00:31:46,601
- The forensic evidence...
- It was a minister's daughter.

427
00:31:46,625 --> 00:31:49,934
- The whole country was turned upside down.
- New prints, which you have to address.

428
00:31:49,958 --> 00:31:51,708
They worked 24-7.

429
00:31:51,791 --> 00:31:55,208
Don't make wild assumptions
if you can't back them up.

430
00:31:57,666 --> 00:31:59,166
There'll be more killings.

431
00:31:59,916 --> 00:32:01,208
What do you mean?

432
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:05,791
What does a chestnut man look like?
It has no hands nor feet.

433
00:32:05,875 --> 00:32:09,041
The first victim was missing one hand.
The next was missing two.

434
00:32:09,625 --> 00:32:11,345
Fuck.
You better not be saying...

435
00:32:11,375 --> 00:32:14,708
These cases are connected
to Kristine Hartung and the chestnut men,

436
00:32:14,791 --> 00:32:16,458
so we have to re-interview the family.

437
00:32:16,541 --> 00:32:18,791
I'll talk to them. You two stay far away.

438
00:32:18,875 --> 00:32:20,666
Until you can back up your claims.

439
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:23,666
Forget about the Hartungs. There must be
something else you've missed.

440
00:32:24,708 --> 00:32:26,375
I'd like to speak to Thulin now.

441
00:32:27,458 --> 00:32:28,791
Alone, thank you.

442
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,541
God damn, he's annoying!

443
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,166
Shall we send him home?

444
00:32:38,791 --> 00:32:39,833
I think he's good.

445
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,291
He's your responsibility.

446
00:32:47,666 --> 00:32:50,416
Why didn't you back me up in there? Huh?

447
00:32:52,041 --> 00:32:53,125
Are you too scared...

448
00:32:53,208 --> 00:32:56,625
You'll be going back to The Hague soon,
and I'll have to pick up the pieces.

449
00:32:57,208 --> 00:32:58,500
Hey, Sebastian. Yeah.

450
00:32:58,583 --> 00:33:01,166
- Can we talk later...
- It may have something to do

451
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:03,125
- with your transfer to cyber crime.
- Yeah.

452
00:33:03,208 --> 00:33:05,791
I'm not the only one
who wants to leave. Am I?

453
00:33:06,416 --> 00:33:08,791
You know what?
You don't know anything about me.

454
00:33:08,875 --> 00:33:09,916
Thulin!

455
00:33:10,875 --> 00:33:13,666
Erik Sejer-Lassen is ready for you
in the meeting room.

456
00:33:20,333 --> 00:33:23,208
Sejer-Lassen, come on.
You must know something.

457
00:33:33,583 --> 00:33:38,666
Laura Kjær. Did Anne know her?
Or ever talk about her?

458
00:33:40,583 --> 00:33:41,958
I don't think so.

459
00:33:43,541 --> 00:33:47,458
Was Anne scared of anyone?
Did she have any enemies or...

460
00:33:47,541 --> 00:33:50,166
Anne just took care of the house
and the kids.

461
00:33:50,791 --> 00:33:52,916
Then why
was she going to leave you?

462
00:33:54,083 --> 00:33:57,916
Your mother-in-law told us
Anne was going to leave you. Why was that?

463
00:34:00,791 --> 00:34:02,166
I've had a few affairs.

464
00:34:02,875 --> 00:34:05,125
Did Anne know about these affairs?

465
00:34:09,875 --> 00:34:11,916
- Yes.
- So your affairs were the reason

466
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,958
why she was going to leave you?

467
00:34:14,041 --> 00:34:15,458
Hm. I guess so.

468
00:34:15,541 --> 00:34:18,125
But... but she also packed for the girls.

469
00:34:18,208 --> 00:34:19,416
That seems serious.

470
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,916
I told you, that's all I know.

471
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:30,666
Crime scene technicians found dried blood
on the living-room floor of your house.

472
00:34:32,166 --> 00:34:33,750
Do you know how it got there?

473
00:34:34,541 --> 00:34:36,500
Our eldest daughter, Sofia, had a fall

474
00:34:36,583 --> 00:34:39,250
and broke her nose and clavicle
a few months ago.

475
00:34:39,333 --> 00:34:42,458
- Was admitted to hospital.
- Admitted to which hospital?

476
00:34:43,333 --> 00:34:44,208
The national hospital.

477
00:34:44,291 --> 00:34:46,875
- Which department?
- I don't know. Pediatrics?

478
00:34:46,958 --> 00:34:48,041
Anne took care of it.

479
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,375
That's where Magnus Kjær was treated.

480
00:34:52,458 --> 00:34:53,541
Yes.

481
00:35:05,666 --> 00:35:07,291
Hi. We called earlier.

482
00:35:07,375 --> 00:35:11,791
We have some questions about two children
who were treated here.

483
00:35:11,875 --> 00:35:14,666
- Is there someone who can help us?
- The attending physician.

484
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:18,375
- But he's doing his rounds.
- Yeah, but we have to talk to him now.

485
00:35:18,458 --> 00:35:23,125
Can I help? We nurses often know
the children better than the doctors.

486
00:35:23,208 --> 00:35:25,250
We need to speak to the attending.

487
00:35:25,333 --> 00:35:28,833
Uh... yes. Wait down the hall.
I'll go get him.

488
00:35:28,916 --> 00:35:29,916
Thanks.

489
00:35:33,375 --> 00:35:36,000
<i>Magnus has been coming
for around a year or so,</i>

490
00:35:36,083 --> 00:35:37,333
<i>for a lengthy review.</i>

491
00:35:37,416 --> 00:35:40,000
Sofia was admitted for a simple fracture

492
00:35:40,083 --> 00:35:43,500
following an accident at her house
a few months ago.

493
00:35:43,583 --> 00:35:46,750
Do you know if the kids knew each other?
Or if the parents did?

494
00:35:46,833 --> 00:35:49,375
No. They didn't seem
to have any contact.

495
00:35:49,458 --> 00:35:51,958
Uh, what's important to understand...

496
00:35:53,375 --> 00:35:56,125
about this department
is that its primary function

497
00:35:56,208 --> 00:36:00,000
- is to filter into other departments.
- Who brought the children in?

498
00:36:01,041 --> 00:36:03,416
Mostly, their mothers, as far as I recall.

499
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,875
If you want to be sure,
you'll have to ask them.

500
00:36:06,916 --> 00:36:08,583
Yeah. But I'm asking you.

501
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:10,541
Yeah, and I just answered.

502
00:36:12,208 --> 00:36:16,291
It's very impressive
that you remember them. And their mothers.

503
00:36:16,916 --> 00:36:20,083
Yes, well, and that's also
one of the most important aspects,

504
00:36:20,166 --> 00:36:22,333
you know, that we can make
the parents feel safe.

505
00:36:22,416 --> 00:36:23,416
Of course.

506
00:36:23,958 --> 00:36:26,583
- Did you know the mothers really well?
- Yes.

507
00:36:28,125 --> 00:36:29,291
What do you mean?

508
00:36:29,375 --> 00:36:30,791
Did you sleep with them?

509
00:36:33,541 --> 00:36:35,166
If these are the questions you have,

510
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:38,375
- I'd rather get back to the children.
- We're not done yet.

511
00:36:42,375 --> 00:36:45,958
Both kids' mothers have been killed.
You're the only link between them.

512
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,833
Well, I... I, um...

513
00:37:00,333 --> 00:37:04,250
I knew Magnus' mother.
I mean, I knew her better than the others,

514
00:37:04,333 --> 00:37:08,166
because Magnus had been in treatment
for so long with his autism.

515
00:37:09,458 --> 00:37:12,083
She was frustrated
because nothing seemed to help.

516
00:37:12,166 --> 00:37:14,750
And then, suddenly,
they just stopped coming in.

517
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:16,333
But why?

518
00:37:16,875 --> 00:37:20,458
She called and said that a report
had been filed with social services.

519
00:37:20,541 --> 00:37:22,708
What do you mean? What kind of report?

520
00:37:24,125 --> 00:37:25,375
Your patients are waiting.

521
00:37:25,458 --> 00:37:26,976
- I'm on my way...
- They have to wait.

522
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,833
What kind of report? Was it about abuse?

523
00:37:28,916 --> 00:37:31,250
I only heard it from his mother,

524
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:34,708
but she said someone
had accused her of neglecting Magnus.

525
00:37:34,791 --> 00:37:38,208
- Did she mention who?
- No.

526
00:37:38,958 --> 00:37:41,458
It was filed anonymously, as I recall.

527
00:37:43,125 --> 00:37:45,125
She was a loving mother, so...

528
00:37:46,708 --> 00:37:47,708
it's not true.

529
00:37:50,166 --> 00:37:52,000
Let's go and get that report.

530
00:37:57,666 --> 00:38:00,916
Secret services believe
that the person who vandalized your car

531
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,833
also emailed you the threat.

532
00:38:02,916 --> 00:38:04,500
Yeah, I had guessed that much.

533
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,458
- Hmm.
- But who is it?

534
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:10,583
The car was parked
in a surveillance blind spot,

535
00:38:10,666 --> 00:38:12,458
so there are no suspects.

536
00:38:12,541 --> 00:38:16,083
Security services insists
on a bodyguard detail.

537
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:19,166
Okay, if there's
no other way around it.

538
00:38:19,958 --> 00:38:22,416
I'd like to inform my family myself.

539
00:38:22,916 --> 00:38:23,916
Of course.

540
00:38:25,041 --> 00:38:27,625
The prime minister was pleased
with your interview.

541
00:38:27,708 --> 00:38:28,791
SAME MURDERER?

542
00:38:28,875 --> 00:38:31,000
- Hm?
- And Bukke wants a meeting.

543
00:38:31,083 --> 00:38:35,708
Great. If we can come to an agreement.
Have him come by my office.

544
00:38:36,333 --> 00:38:37,208
Thanks.

545
00:38:37,291 --> 00:38:41,708
Um, sorry, but the head of homicide asked
if you and your husband had time to meet.

546
00:38:41,791 --> 00:38:42,791
It's important.

547
00:38:50,208 --> 00:38:51,708
Uh...

548
00:38:53,375 --> 00:38:55,833
Uh, thank you for making time to see me.

549
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:58,791
I'll make it brief.
I know you have another meeting.

550
00:39:02,166 --> 00:39:07,208
In connection with another murder case,
we found another chestnut man

551
00:39:08,375 --> 00:39:10,291
with Kristine's fingerprints.

552
00:39:11,583 --> 00:39:14,375
It's a woman. Anne Sejer-Lassen.

553
00:39:15,416 --> 00:39:16,541
Do you know her?

554
00:39:17,333 --> 00:39:18,333
No.

555
00:39:20,166 --> 00:39:23,416
They live in Klampenborg.
Her husband was Erik Sejer-Lassen.

556
00:39:24,541 --> 00:39:27,125
We've just begun our investigation,

557
00:39:27,208 --> 00:39:30,708
but it's most likely a matter
of malicious harassment directed at you.

558
00:39:30,791 --> 00:39:33,916
- But how come?
- Uh... I wish I had an answer.

559
00:39:35,166 --> 00:39:37,833
We're working
with the security services,

560
00:39:37,916 --> 00:39:40,250
and I know
you've received threats at your job.

561
00:39:41,666 --> 00:39:44,291
Yes. Yes, it doesn't keep me up at night.

562
00:39:44,375 --> 00:39:47,250
- Wh... what kind of threats?
- I'll tell you later.

563
00:39:47,333 --> 00:39:49,708
I know this is painful for you.

564
00:39:49,791 --> 00:39:52,041
I promise we'll catch whoever it is,

565
00:39:52,125 --> 00:39:55,125
- so you can get some peace.
- That would be nice.

566
00:39:55,208 --> 00:39:56,416
I... I just have to...

567
00:39:57,416 --> 00:39:58,416
Yeah?

568
00:40:00,041 --> 00:40:03,375
If you've found her fingerprints again...

569
00:40:03,458 --> 00:40:04,458
Yeah?

570
00:40:06,291 --> 00:40:07,708
Then it could mean...

571
00:40:09,541 --> 00:40:10,916
that Kristine...

572
00:40:12,083 --> 00:40:13,416
she could be alive?

573
00:40:15,875 --> 00:40:20,375
Steen, no. I'm sorry.
Fingerprints can last for many years.

574
00:40:20,458 --> 00:40:23,666
The killer could have obtained
those figures a long time ago.

575
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:25,958
But... but how can you be sure?

576
00:40:26,041 --> 00:40:29,041
I know it's hard to accept
what happened, Steen,

577
00:40:29,125 --> 00:40:31,791
but this doesn't change anything.

578
00:40:31,875 --> 00:40:32,875
Sorry.

579
00:40:36,375 --> 00:40:37,833
- Nylander?
- Yeah.

580
00:40:38,375 --> 00:40:39,500
Please excuse me.

581
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:44,375
I was just wondering about these.

582
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:47,666
- If you could sign...
- I was, uh... threatened twice.

583
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:52,166
First in an email and then by vandalism
on my car, but it's nothing special.

584
00:40:52,708 --> 00:40:54,416
But security services

585
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:57,041
- have assigned a detail...
- It's nothing special?

586
00:40:57,625 --> 00:41:00,166
Two women were murdered.
You were threatened.

587
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:02,083
Kristine's fingerprints are turning up.

588
00:41:02,166 --> 00:41:03,333
What's going on?

589
00:41:03,416 --> 00:41:06,041
Rosa, your driver
wants to get you moving.

590
00:41:07,916 --> 00:41:08,958
Can't you cancel?

591
00:41:11,958 --> 00:41:13,916
I can't. I need to meet with Bukke.

592
00:41:14,875 --> 00:41:15,916
I won't be late.

593
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:19,875
- Thanks for coming.
- Yes. Thank you.

594
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:25,666
- Yeah.
- Thanks, Steen.

595
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,333
SEARCH FOR KRISTINE HARTUNG
ABANDONED

596
00:42:23,458 --> 00:42:25,583
No, there's no problem
at all, Aksel.

597
00:42:25,666 --> 00:42:28,041
I've just shopped
for the Halloween party, okay?

598
00:42:28,125 --> 00:42:30,458
I'll meet you at the school. Bye.

599
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Social services did indeed receive
an anonymous report about Laura Kjær,

600
00:42:42,083 --> 00:42:43,666
requesting forced removal.

601
00:42:45,208 --> 00:42:47,500
"The whore is ignoring
her child's needs,

602
00:42:47,583 --> 00:42:49,416
despite knowing better."

603
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:52,875
Further down, it reads that evidence
of the abuse can be found in the home.

604
00:42:52,958 --> 00:42:55,708
- Okay. What did they find?
- Nothing.

605
00:42:56,708 --> 00:42:58,750
So they don't know who reported them?

606
00:42:59,666 --> 00:43:02,125
Uh, no. That's, like,
the meaning of "anonymous".

607
00:43:02,208 --> 00:43:03,416
What about Sejer-Lassen?

608
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:06,250
- Any report on them?
- Not according to the social worker.

609
00:43:07,041 --> 00:43:08,666
Let's go back to the Kjær house.

610
00:43:09,833 --> 00:43:11,708
Okay, let's have a look.

611
00:43:28,583 --> 00:43:32,083
I need to get back to the station
before my daughter's Halloween party.

612
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,958
Don't you have anyone waiting at home?

613
00:43:37,375 --> 00:43:40,625
I can see you're married.
Or did she kick you out?

614
00:43:40,708 --> 00:43:41,708
I'll check the house.

615
00:43:41,791 --> 00:43:43,708
- You talk to the neighbors.
- Yeah.

616
00:43:43,791 --> 00:43:46,541
No matter what, somebody bothered
to report Laura Kjær.

617
00:43:49,083 --> 00:43:50,250
The keys?

618
00:44:19,666 --> 00:44:21,916
- Hey, Francois.
<i>- Bonjour, mon ami.</i>

619
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,416
<i>Well, he says
he's willing to forget what has happened.</i>

620
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:28,500
<i>But I think it would speed things up
if you call him and give him an apology.</i>

621
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:30,916
I will. I'll talk to Freimann later.

622
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,333
<i>I think that's the best option.
I cleared the way for you.</i>

623
00:44:33,416 --> 00:44:37,083
- Thanks. Well done.
- <i>You'll be back before you know it.</i>

624
00:44:37,166 --> 00:44:39,208
- See you soon, then.
- <i>Okay, ciao.</i>

625
00:44:55,833 --> 00:44:56,833
Found out anything?

626
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,625
The neighbors call them a lovely family.

627
00:45:01,708 --> 00:45:06,291
No one saw anything or had any reason
to file anonymous reports, so...

628
00:45:07,333 --> 00:45:08,666
Oh. Okay.

629
00:45:09,208 --> 00:45:11,916
Yeah. Just go home to your son.
I'll take it from here.

630
00:45:12,416 --> 00:45:14,375
I'll lock up when I leave.

631
00:45:16,583 --> 00:45:17,583
Okay.

632
00:45:22,833 --> 00:45:23,833
My son!

633
00:45:29,375 --> 00:45:30,655
<i>Finally, you called!</i>

634
00:45:30,708 --> 00:45:33,833
- Hey, Sebastian. Are you still at work?
<i>- Yes. What's up?</i>

635
00:45:33,916 --> 00:45:36,250
I just really need to see a normal person.

636
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:37,416
<i>Come see me.</i>

637
00:45:46,083 --> 00:45:48,208
<i>Hey, Thulin.</i>

638
00:45:48,291 --> 00:45:51,000
Hey. Can you get Abildgård
to look up a licence plate for me?

639
00:45:51,083 --> 00:45:54,833
<i>- Yeah, what's the number?</i>
- Thanks. It's BS 23 512.

640
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:58,916
<i>Yeah, I'll have him call you
as soon as it's done. What's it about?</i>

641
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,916
Uh, I don't know, but, um...

642
00:46:02,333 --> 00:46:04,208
Have him call me
as soon as he's got something.

643
00:46:04,291 --> 00:46:05,458
<i>I'll do that.</i>

644
00:48:44,458 --> 00:48:45,708
Hey.

645
00:48:49,375 --> 00:48:50,500
- Hi.
- Hey!

646
00:48:50,583 --> 00:48:52,833
- Thought you were busy?
- No, I'm very busy.

647
00:48:52,916 --> 00:48:54,333
I only have ten minutes.

648
00:48:54,416 --> 00:48:55,416
I see...

649
00:48:56,416 --> 00:48:57,875
Okay.

650
00:48:58,625 --> 00:49:00,166
I just thought that, um...

651
00:49:03,166 --> 00:49:05,125
Yeah. I don't know what I thought.

652
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:23,250
Can't you just
let it ring for once?

653
00:49:23,333 --> 00:49:24,750
Do you have to answer?

654
00:49:27,333 --> 00:49:28,533
Abildgård, what's up?

655
00:51:51,083 --> 00:51:52,083
Hess?

656
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,041
Police!

657
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Turn around.

658
00:52:19,875 --> 00:52:21,000
Turn around now!

659
00:52:24,541 --> 00:52:26,708
Hauge, what are you doing here?

660
00:52:27,333 --> 00:52:28,333
You can't be here.

661
00:52:28,791 --> 00:52:30,708
What the hell are you doing, huh?

662
00:52:30,791 --> 00:52:33,458
Hey! Fuck!

663
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,375
What was that?

664
00:52:42,916 --> 00:52:43,916
Where's Hess?

665
00:52:45,708 --> 00:52:46,708
Move that.

666
00:52:48,583 --> 00:52:49,583
Open it!

667
00:52:59,750 --> 00:53:00,583
Hess!

668
00:53:00,666 --> 00:53:01,875
Get the laptop.

669
